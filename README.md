## About
Smasherscape is a leaderboard system designed for tracking player statistics. This component provides an interactive leaderboard system, where admins can add, delete, update, and search for players, along with their respective statistics.

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:strawhat19/Smasherscape.git
cd Smasherscape/
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage
Players can level up and gain experience while keeping a track record of their wins, defeats, deaths, characters played and level. Players can level up to gain rewards, search for their card and expand to view details, or view other player data on the leaderboard.

Each player card displays detailed player statistics, including the player's name, level, record, and characters played. Each card also includes an XP progress bar that indicates the player's progress towards the next level.
